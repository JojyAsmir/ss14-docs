[head=3]Tip 1 - Beds[/head]
When treating someone's injuries, the location of the operation is important, and can make the difference between their survival or death.

[bullet/]If a patient is alive, they should be placed on a Medical Bed. The bed improves the body's natural ability to heal, taking some of the pressure off of you to act quickly.

[bullet/]If a patient is deceased, they should be placed on a Stasis Bed, if at all possible. These will prevent their body from decaying. [bold]Do not place living patients on stasis beds! They will suffocate![/bold]
